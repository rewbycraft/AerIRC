# AerIRC - Project Aeris IRC Library

## What is this?

This is the repository for AerIRC.
AerIRC is the IRC library for Aeris.
At the moment, AerIRC is unfinished and completely broken in most cases.

## What is it written in?

AerIRC is written in Scala and uses the Akka framework.
The goal is for this library to be fully capable of communicating over the IRC protocol, RFC2812.
At the moment the compatibility leaves a lot to be desired.
I will attempt to implement as much as I can find the energy to do.

## Usage/contribution

If you're interested in using this library and/or contributing, great!
Shoot me a PM and I'll do my best to help you set up the library and fix bugs/implement missing functionality.
There's a file called TestApp.scala in src/test/scala which shows basic usage.

## Licensing

This code is under MIT license. See LICENSE.

## Downloads/maven

I hope to get a maven repo up for this soon-ish. No promises.
